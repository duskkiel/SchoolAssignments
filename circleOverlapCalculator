# Description: This program is designed to allow the user to input the center and radius of two different circles. It
#              will then determine whether the circles overlap or if one of them is inside the other.

radiusFirst = eval(input("Enter the radius of the first circle: "))
x2, y2 = eval(input("Enter the center of the second circle x, y: "))
radiusSecond = eval(input("Enter the radius of the second circle: "))

turtle.goto(x1, y1 - radiusFirst)
